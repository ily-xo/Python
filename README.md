# Python Portfolio
- Welcome to my Python Repository, including some highlights from my [Data 8](http://www.data8.org/) course, Computational Models of Cognition [CogSci 131](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-cogsci-131-001-lec-001) course, and more projects. I am looking forward to expanding my breadth of knowledge within the data science space. 

Highlights:
- Developed a streamlined workflow for hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, achieving optimal parameters for Logistic Regression (C=0.37, penalty='l2', solver='sag') and XGBoost (subsample=0.075, n_estimators=200, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.087, colsample_bytree=0.971).

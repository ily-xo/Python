# Python Portfolio
Welcome to my Python Repository, a compilation of projects that reflect my journey to self-learn Python. My completion of the [Data 8](http://www.data8.org/) course, and the Computational Models of Cognition [CogSci 131](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-cogsci-131-001-lec-001) course, offered by UC Berkeley has solidified my breadth of knowledge in data science principles.

# Python Portfolio
Welcome to My Python Repository, a compilation of projects that reflect my journey and insights gained from the Data 8 course at the University of California, Berkeley. This repository serves as a showcase of the skills and knowledge I've acquired in the field of data science, influenced by the comprehensive curriculum provided at UC Berkeley.

## About the Data 8 Course

The [Data 8](http://www.data8.org/) course offered by UC Berkeley is designed to provide a solid foundation in data science principles and practices. Throughout the course, I have delved into fundamental concepts related to data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and more. The interactive and hands-on approach of the course has enabled me to develop a deep understanding of key data science techniques and their practical applications.

## Repository Contents

From data preprocessing and analysis to visualization and modeling, I am set on mastering data-driven decision-making.
